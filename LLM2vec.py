instructions = instructions = """You are given a list of morphological features of mosquitoes and a user’s description of an observed specimen. Your task is to output a vector indicating which features are present in the description.

Use the following rules:
- For each element, write `A` if the description matches only the feature marked as `A`, and doesn't match feature `B`.
- Write `B` for that element if the description doesn't match feature `A`, and instead matches the feature marked as `B`.
- Write `nan` for that element if the description doesn't match either feature.
- Write `nan`for that element if the description matches both features.
- Write `nan` for that element if the input doesn’t provide enough information to decide.
- Separate the corresponding value for each feature with a comma.
- Don't add square brackets or any spaces to the final vector. Only characters it can contain are `nan`, `A` and `B`
- verify that the output consists of `A`, `B` and `nan`, all separated by commas
- if there are no usable features in the input, return a vector with the format `nan,nan,...,nan`
- don't add any other text or explanations
- before deciding the value for any given feature, double check whether it should instead be `nan`.
- Most of the elements should be `nan`
- Return a vector with values in the same order as the feature list.

### Example input for a single feature:
'Legs sparsely speckled'

### Expected reasoning for that feature:
Comparing that statement to the features, we see that speckled legs are mentioned in feature 3:
3- A: Legs speckled, sometimes sparsely, B: Legs not speckled
The input matches statement 3 A, and doesn't match 3B, so position 3 in the final vector should be 'A'.

Notice that feature 18 (A: Legs speckled, B: Legs not speckled) should also be 'A'.

### Example input for multiple features:
'Abdominal segments with laterally projecting tufts of scales on segments II-VII. Wing with abundant pale areas, costa with at least 4 pale spots. Hindtarsomeres 1 to 4, at least, with apical pale bands. Hindtarsomeres 1 and 2 with pale bands at apices only. Hindtarsomeres 3 and 4 not all white nor narrowly dark basally, hindtarsomere 5  not all dark nor with basal 0.5 dark. Hindtarsomere 5 and about apical 0.5 of 4 pale.'

### Expected Output for multiple features:
[A, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, B, B, B, B, nan, nan, A, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]

### Additional context:
- area: a broad, less defined region of color or texture. For example, a "dark area" on the wing could mean a large portion covered by dark scales, without a sharp boundary.
- band: a continuous stripe that runs across a segment, usually transverse. For example, a "pale band on the tarsus" means a light-colored ring that encircles the segment.
- spot: a relatively small, discrete patch of scales that is clearly localized, not coninuous.
- patch: similar to a spot but usually larger and less regularly shaped, often referring to a cluster of scales.
- ring: specifically circular or encircling markings, often used on leg segments.
- interruption: when a marking (often a band or ring) is broken or incomplete.
- tarsus: most distal portion of the leg
- tarsomere: segment of the last portion of the leg
- When something is described as "dark at apex", it means the apex is predominantly dark, but it may still have a few scattered pale scales, as long as there isn't a strong pale annulus interrupting. For example, palps with a dark base but with 1 to 2 pale interruptions can still be considered dark at base.
- "apex" refers to the terminal portion of the segment, not just the extreme tip. It can be anywhere between the last half and the last quarter.
- consider "white" and "pale" as synonyms. Occasionally, "white" might be used to show a sharper contrast, but consider them synonyms for the most part.
- consider "dark" and "black" as synonyms
- the term "apical" might be described as "distal"
- the wing contains veins that, from the top down are named: costa, sub-costa or subcosta, vein 1, vein 2, vein 3, vein 4, vein 5 and vein 6
- "wing vein 1 without usual main dark areas" generally implies that they are missing entirely, rather than one being absent or the set of bands being replaced by a different set.
- veins 5 and 6 might be described as "posterior veins"
- something "without distinct bands" may not be uniform in color; it just means it has no clearly defined, crisp regions that encircle the segment and stand out as bands.
- the costa can be called the "top vein" or "leading edge".
- Vein 1 can be called the radius 1, "R1", or the "first branch of the radius".
- vein 2 can be called Radius 2+3, "r2+3", or the "second branch of the radius".
- vein 3 can be called Radius 4+5, "r4+5", or the "third branch of the radius".
- vein 4 can be called Media, "M", or "medial vein".
- vein 5 can be called Cubitus, "Cu" or "cubital vein".
- vein 6 can be called Anal, "A", or "anal vein".
- The spots on the wing can be called "humeral spot" (at the base of the wing, near the costa, or "basal costal spot"); "presector spot" (just before sector vein along costa, or "costal pre-sector spot"); "median spot" (mid-wing on radial veins, or "central spot"); "preaccessory spot" (before accessory vein along costa, or "costal pre-accessory spot"); "preapical spot" (near wing tip, not at apex, or "subapical"); "subapical spot" (just before apex along main veins, or "distal costal spot"). They can also be described relative to the costa or specific veins.
- the feature "3rd main dark area of wing vein 1 with a pale interruption, sometimes fused with preceding pale spot" can be described as a "gambiae gap"
- Decumbent scales: scales that lie flat or nearly flat against the surface they cover, rather than sticking out (erect scales) or lying completely appressed. They can be on various body parts-  commonly the thorax, scutum, head and legs, depending on the species. They lay along the surface, often forming background coloration rather than highlighting a structure.
- Usually, a band would be described as "narrow" if it covered roughly a quarter or less of the segment's length or width, unless otherwise stated.
- usually, a band would be described as "broad" if it covered  roughly ahalf or more of the segment's length or width-
- intermediate" or "moderate" bands are anything in between narrow and broad.
- If the user or the key specifies a different percentage, let that take precedence over the definitions for "narrow", "broad" and "intermediate".
